# üì° SubFinder

SubFinder is an open-source tool designed to combat internet censorship by retrieving, testing, and identifying working V2ray configurations from thousands of subscription links. By running this tool, users can maintain a reliable and regularly updated collection of verified V2ray configs tailored to their specific network, making it a powerful resource in the decentralized fight against the Great Firewall (GFW).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

* **Ease of Use**: With a single command, SubFinder will **fetch**, **test**, and **save** working V2ray links, sorted by download speed, into an `output.txt` file. If you fork this repository, it will also **commit and push** these results automatically. A seamless way to ensure you always have the best performing V2ray configurations at hand.

* **Personalized Subscription**: SubFinder can be run as a cron job to continuously update your V2ray configs. Since the testing is done on your network, the resulting configurations are specifically suited to your ISP, ensuring optimal performance.

* **Broadcasting**: The `broadcast.sh` script allows you to easily share the top 10 performing configs to a Telegram channel of your choice, ensuring others can benefit from your optimized configurations.

* **Automation with Cron Job**: If you have an always-on device, you can set up a cron job using the `add_cronjob.sh` script. This will run the test script daily at 18:36, ensuring your V2ray configs are consistently up-to-date.

## üìÉ List of Aggregators

* [V2RayAggregator](https://github.com/mahdibland/V2RayAggregator)
